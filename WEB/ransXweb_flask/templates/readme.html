<br>

Interactive Web Studio for rans(eXtreme) is controlled by 3 dropdowns allowing you to select RANS equation you are
interested in
calculated from several 2D/3D simulations of core convection in stars at various resolutions done by the hydrodynamic code PROMPI. <br>

<br>
Its operation is based on 4 simple steps:

<ol>
    <li>choose 2D/3D simulation from Model</li>
    <li>choose available resolution from Resolution</li>
    <li>choose RANS equation of interest from Equation </li>
    <li>click Submit</li>
</ol>

When you hover your mouse over the plots, pay attention to lower left corner for three symbols allowing you to zoom in as if you worked with python's matplotlib plots.
