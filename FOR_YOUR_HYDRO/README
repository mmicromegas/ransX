THESE SUBROUTINES CONTAIN CODE USED IN PROMPI TO CALCULATE AND STORE RANS DATA

prompi.f90 - main code tells you when to calculate rans fields using rans_avg.f90 and store the rans data using dumpdata.f90

rans_avg.f90 - main subroutine for calculation of rans mean fields

dumpdata.f90 - dumpdata subroutine. rans data are written by write_rans_files.f90

write_rans_files.f90 - writes ranshead and ransdat data (needed by our python's post-processing)

write_rans_header.f90 - writes ranshead files

write_rans_data.f90 - write ransdat files

burnf.f90 - burn subroutine containing calculation of the xnucdot required by the rans_avg.f90
